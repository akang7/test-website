### About me

I am a second year MPH student at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) pursuing a concentration in [Epidemiology](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/degrees/masters-programs/master-public-health/columbia-mph/mph-epidemiology) and a certificate in [Applied Biostatistics](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/degrees/masters-programs/master-public-health/certificates/applied-biostatistics). I received a BA in Molecular and Cell Biology and Public Health at UC Berkeley in 2016. For my honors thesis, I studied the relationship between Coenzyme Q (CoQ) and beige adipogenesis in a human cell model.  

I recently interned at the [NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page) in the Division of Informatics Information Technology and Telecommunications researching the validity of internal provider data (Provider Data Warehouse) compared to data from public sources, including Medicaid Claims and NPPES NPI Registry. 


### Random

On a less serious note, I seriously love ice cream and when I was in college, I wrote a blog post dedicated to all the "*artisanal*" ice cream I had in the Bay Area. It's a mix of Berkeley-pretentiousness and passion - I poured my soul into writing this post so [check it out](http://ashleykanggg.tumblr.com/post/94611347893/ice-creameries-in-the-bay)
