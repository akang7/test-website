I am a second year MPH student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health pursuing a concentration in Epidemiology and a certificate in Applied Biostatistics. I recently interned at the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in the Division of Informatics Information Technology and Telecommunications researching the validity of internal provider data (Provider Data Warehouse) compared to data from public sources, including Medicaid Claims and NPPES NPI Registry.
